# PortChecking

This script is an alternative for those that don't want to use Telnet, and to whom that are using an outdated Powershell version.
The script will help to perform similar function to Test-NetConnnection.

Just have a list of your selected server's IP in CSV and you're good to go.

Have fun using it and feel free to improvise it on your version.
